 * The widget view has two parameters: widget and content
 *
 * widget: The widget to display, use the widget as you wish to render the view
 * content: This variable is computed in this WidgetManager, you can set whatever you want in it and display it in the show view
 *
 * The content variable depends of the mode: static/businessEntity/entity/query
 *
 * The content is given depending of the mode by the methods:
 *  getWidgetStaticContent
 *  getWidgetBusinessEntityContent
 *  getWidgetEntityContent
 *  getWidgetQueryContent
 *
 * So, you can use the widget or the content in the show.html.twig view.
 * If you want to do some computation, use the content and do it the 4 previous methods.
 *
 * If you just want to use the widget and not the content, remove the method that throws the exceptions.
 *
 * By default, the methods throws Exception to notice the developer that he should implements it owns logic for the widget
